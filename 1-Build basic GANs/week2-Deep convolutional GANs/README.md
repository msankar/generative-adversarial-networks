# Deep Convolutional GANs

Learn about different activation functions, batch normalization, and transposed convolutions to tune your GAN architecture and apply them to build an advanced DCGAN specifically for processing images!


Be able to explain the components of a Deep Convolutional GAN.
Compose a Deep Convolutional GAN using these components.
Examine the difference between upsampling and transposed convolutions.
