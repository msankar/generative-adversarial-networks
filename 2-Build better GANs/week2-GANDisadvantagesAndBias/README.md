# GAN Disadvantages and Bias

Learn the disadvantages of GANs when compared to other generative models, discover the pros/cons of these models—plus, learn about the many places where bias in machine learning can come from, why it’s important, and an approach to identify it in GANs!

## Learning Objectives

- Propose generative model alternatives to GANs and their pros/cons.
- Scrutinize bias in machine learning and examine its various sources.
- Describe an application of GANs that demonstrates bias.
- Explain several definitions of fairness in machine learning.
