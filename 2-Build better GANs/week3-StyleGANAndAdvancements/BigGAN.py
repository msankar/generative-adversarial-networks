# # Components of BigGAN
# 
# In this notebook, you'll learn about and implement the components of BigGAN, the first large-scale GAN architecture proposed in [Large Scale GAN Training for High Fidelity Natural Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096) (Brock et al. 2019). BigGAN performs a conditional generation task, so unlike StyleGAN, it conditions on a certain class to generate results. BigGAN is based mainly on empirical results and shows extremely good results when trained on ImageNet and its 1000 classes.
# 
# The authors propose a several changes that improve state-of-the-art Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID), including:
#  - **Increasing batch size by a factor of 8**, which improves IS by 46% and improves FID by 35%, but also induces complete mode collapse in training.
#  - **Increasing the number of convolutional channels by 1.5x**, which improves IS by 21% and FID by 23%.
#  - **Using shared class-conditional embeddings $c$ in BatchNorm layers**, which reduces the number of parameters and increases IS by 2% and FID by 4%.
#  - **Adding skip connections from latent noise $z$** by concatenating chunks of $z$ to $c$. This improves IS by 1% and FID by 5%.

# ## The Truncation Trick and Orthogonal Regularization
# 
# You should already be familiar with the truncation trick, which truncates the range of values of random noise $z$. Truncation to values close to 0 increases fidelity but decreases variety. Truncation to values further from 0 does the opposite.
# 
# Truncation results in a different distribution of $z$ values from the one seen in training, which can cause saturation artifacts. The authors address this by making $G$ well-defined, or *smooth*, on the full distribution of $z$ values.
# 
# To do this, they employ orthogonal regularization, first introduced in [Neural Photo Editing with Introspective Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07093) (Brock et al. 2017). The authors modify this regularization technique for BigGAN and formulate it as
# 
# \begin{align*}
#   R_\beta(W) = \beta\big|\big|W^\top W \odot (\pmb{1} - I)\big|\big|^2_F,
# \end{align*}
# where $\pmb{1}$ denotes a matrix of 1's. This regularization term removes the diagonal terms from the regularization and aims to minimize the pairwise cosine similarity between filters without constraining their norm.

# ## BigGAN Parts
# 
# Before jumping into the full implementation, let's first take a look at some submodules that will be important in our BigGAN implementation later.

# ### Class-conditional Batch Normalization
# 
# Recall that batch norm aims to normalize activation statistics to a standard gaussian distribution (via an exponential moving average of minibatch mean and variances) but also applies trainable parameters, $\gamma$ and $\beta$, to invert this operation if the model sees fit:
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     y &= \dfrac{x - \hat{\mu}}{\hat{\sigma} + \epsilon} * \gamma + \beta.
# \end{align*}
# 
# BigGAN injects class-conditional information by parameterizing $\gamma$ and $\beta$ as linear transformations of the class embedding, $c$. Recall that BigGAN also concatenates $c$ with $z$ skip connections (denoted $[c, z]$), so
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \gamma &:= W_\gamma^\top[c, z] \\
#     \beta &:= W_\beta^\top[c, z]
# \end{align*}
# 
# The idea is actually very similar to the adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) module that you implemented in the StyleGAN notebook, so we've copied that code in comments below for reference.

# ### Self-Attention Block
# 
# As you may already know, self-attention has been a successful technique in helping models learn arbitrary, long-term dependencies. [Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08318) (Zhang et al. 2018) first introduced the self-attention mechanism into the GAN architecture. BigGAN augments its residual blocks with these attention blocks.
# 
# **A Quick Primer on Self-Attention**
# 
# Self-attention is just **scaled dot product attention**. Given a sequence $S$ (with images, $S$ is just the image flattened across its height and width), the model learns mappings to query ($Q$), key ($K$), and value ($V$) matrices:
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     Q &:= W_q^\top S \\
#     K &:= W_k^\top S \\
#     V &:= W_v^\top S
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $W_q$, $W_k$, and $W_v$ are learned parameters. The subsequent self-attention mechanism is then computed as
# 
# \begin{align*}
#     \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\dfrac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
# \end{align*}
# 
# where $d_k$ is the dimensionality of the $Q, K$ matrices (SA-GAN and BigGAN both omit this term). Intuitively, you can think of the *query* matrix as containing the representations of each position with respect to itself and the *key* matrix as containing the representations of each position with respect to the others. How important two positions are to each other is measured by dot product as $QK^\top$, hence **dot product attention**. A softmax is applied to convert these relative importances to a probability distribution over all positions.
# 
# 
# Intuitively, the *value* matrix provides the importance weighting of the attention at each position, hence **scaled dot product attention**. Relevant positions should be assigned larger weight and irrelevant ones should be assigned smaller weight.
# 
# Don't worry if you don't understand this right away - it's a tough concept! For extra reading, you should check out [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (Vaswani et al. 2017), which is the paper that first introduces this technique, and [The Illustrated Transformer](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/), which breaks down and explains the self-attention mechanism clearly.

# ## BigGAN Generator
# 
# Before implementing the generator in full, you first need to implement the generator residual block.
# 
# ### Generator Residual Block
# 
# As with many state-of-the-art computer vision models, BigGAN employs skip connections in the form of residual blocks to map random noise to a fake image. You can think of BigGAN residual blocks as having 3 steps. Given input $x$ and class embedding $y$:
#  1. $h :=$ `bn-relu-upsample-conv`$(x, y)$
#  2. $h :=$ `bn-relu-conv`$(h, y)$
#  3. $x :=$ `upsample-conv`$(x)$,
# 
# after which you can apply a residual connection and return $h + x$.

# ## BigGAN Discriminator
# 
# Before implementing the discriminator in full, you need to implement a discriminator residual block, which is simpler than the generator's. Note that the last residual block does not apply downsampling.
#  1. $h :=$ `relu-conv-relu-downsample`$(x)$
#  2. $x :=$ `conv-downsample`$(x)$
# 
# In the official BigGAN implementation, the architecture is slightly different for the first discriminator residual block, since it handles the raw image as input:
#  1. $h :=$ `conv-relu-downsample`$(x)$
#  2. $x :=$ `downsample-conv`$(x)$
# 
# After these two steps, you can return the residual connection $h + x$. You might notice that there is no class information in these residual blocks. As you'll see later in the code, the authors inject class-conditional information after the final hidden layer (and before the output layer) via channel-wise dot product.

z = torch.randn(batch_size, z_dim, device=device)                 # Generate random noise (z)
y = torch.arange(start=0, end=n_classes, device=device).long()    # Generate a batch of labels (y), one for each class

# ## BigGAN-deep
# 
# Initially, the authors of the BigGAN paper didn't find much help in increasing the depth of the network. But they experimented further (research is always improving!) and added a few notes about an additional architecture, called BigGAN-deep. This modification of BigGAN is 4x deeper, sports a modified residual block architecture, and concatenates the entire $z$ vector to $c$ (as opposed to separate chunks at different resolutions).
# 
# Typically on a difficult and complex task that you're unlikely to overfit, you expect better performance when a model has more parameters, because it has more room to learn. Surprisingly, BigGAN-deep has fewer parameters than its BigGAN counterpart. Architectural optimizations such as using depthwise separable convolutions and truncating/concatenating channels in skip connections (as opposed to using pointwise convolutions) decrease parameters without trading expressivity.
# 
# For more details on the BigGAN-deep architecture, see Appendix B of the paper.
# 
# And as for the implementation of the BigGAN-deep variant, well, that's left as an exercise for the reader. You're a smart cookie, you'll figure it out! Just keep in mind that with great power comes great responsibility ;)
