# Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

- Explore the applications of GANs and examine them wrt data augmentation, privacy, and anonymity

- Leverage the image-to-image translation framework and identify applications to modalities beyond images

- Implement Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image translation GAN, to adapt satellite images into map routes (and vice versa)

- Compare paired image-to-image translation to unpaired image-to-image translation and identify how their key difference necessitates different GAN architectures

- Implement CycleGAN, an unpaired image-to-image translation model, to adapt horses to zebras (and vice versa) with two GANs in one
