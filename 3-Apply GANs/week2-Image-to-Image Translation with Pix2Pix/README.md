# Image-to-Image Translation with Pix2Pix

Understand image-to-image translation, learn about different applications of this framework, and implement a U-Net generator and Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image translation GAN!

## Learning Objectives

- Learn and leverage the image-to-image translation framework.
- Identify extensions, generalizations, and applications of this framework to modalities beyond images.
- Implement a paired image-to-image translation GAN, called Pix2Pix, to turn satellite images into map routes (and vice versa), with advanced U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator architectures.
