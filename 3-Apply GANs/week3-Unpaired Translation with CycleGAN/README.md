# Evaluation of GANs

Understand the challenges of evaluating GANs, learn about the advantages and disadvantages of different GAN performance measures, and implement the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) method using embeddings to assess the accuracy of GANs!

## Learning Objectives

Differentiate across different evaluation metrics and their pros/cons.
Justify the use of feature embeddings in GAN evaluation.
Evaluate your GANs by implementing Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Inception Score.
