# Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks

- Assess the challenges of evaluating GANs and compare different generative models
- Use the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) method to evaluate the fidelity and diversity of GANs
- Identify sources of bias and the ways to detect it in GANs
- Learn and implement the techniques associated with the state-of-the-art StyleGANs
